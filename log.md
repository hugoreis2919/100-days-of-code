# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4th January, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Set up Github and learnt how to create a repository, create a branch, make changes and push them to GitHub as commits and how to open and merge a pull request.
* Started work on a CSS replica of a friend's business logo (an hourglass with sharp angles)

**Thoughts:** 
* Would be good to animate the sand running out of the hourglass. I should investigate whether to do this purely with CSS or with canvas and javascript... Or perhaps I should implement both solutions as practice.

**Link to work:** 
* [Hello World Repo](https://github.com/tommendable/hello-world "Hello World Repo")
* [TimesUp Logo - CSS](http://codepen.io/tomlittlechild/pen/ZLEOVW "TimesUp Logo")
